                <p>In the summer of 2018, I was back home in Redmond, WA interning at Microsoft. As a part of the Identity team, I worked in the Microsoft Authenticator iOS Application codebase My team and I worked to implement a backup and restore feature that allows users of the Authenticator App to store and reload authentication tokens  on a new phone.</p>
                <p>We implemented the feature using our team's API's to integrate their new decentralized identity service into the application as the feature largely served as a proof of concept. Playing the roles of both PM and developer, my team and I saw the feature from end to end starting with specifications, to UI/UX mocks and reviews, to actual implementation.</p>

                        <p>This semester, fall 2018, I have been a teaching assistant with the college of computing for CS 1100 - Freshman Leap Seminar.</p>
                        <p>This is a freshman seminar class for computer science and computational media students at Gergia Tech. The class is meant to ease the transition of high school students into the GT commmunity while also providing the information and resources for first year students to hit the ground running and succeed in the their first year.</p>
                        <p>As a TA, I act as both a mentor and a peer. As a mentor, I review resumes and cover letters, give feedback on elevator pitches, help students plan their semesters out academically, and provide information and advising on course and specialization selection.</p>
                        <p>As a peer, I try to be a supportive member of the community and answer and questions they may have. I try to connect them to student organizations and ensure that they are not overloading thenselves while also getting the most out of their college experience as possible.</p>
